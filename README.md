# Logic Networks

Powerful, node-based logic and logistical programming within Minecraft.

## Todo list
- Logistics
- Check and sync the validity of linking cards inside nodes on the server
- Save and sync network with keybind from the graph screen
- Node search box categories
- Bitwise operators
- Screens
- String & NBT signals
- Wrench for faster breaking and keeping data
- Network copying
- Block breakable tags
- Integrated recipes (create filling, thermal etc once it's updated)
- Network caches - block that, when detected on the side of an anchor, replaces default signal writing behavior and instead writes to the block's value map
